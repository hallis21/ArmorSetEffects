# ArmorSetEffects
Minecraft spigot/Bukkit plugin.

This plugin allows you to specify armor sets so that if a player equips all required armor pieces they are given specified effects (potion effects).

You can specify an unlimited amount of sets, as well as unlimited effects per set. The plugin also supports having required item names (e.g. change it with an anvil), and meta-data (flavour text).



# Installation
To install simply put the ArmorSet.jar in your plugin folder.
To generate readme.txt simply run the plugin once. This will create a plugin folder containing everything you need to get started.

To build this use "mvn package install"
